# Charles Book Club

The Charles Book Club case study comes from the textbook *Data Mining for Business Analytics*. For a statistical learning class at the University of Wisconsin - La Crosse, I completed a report to compare different models to random sampling in hopes of more accurately targeting customers to increase book purchases. The data has not been included due to privacy restrictions.
